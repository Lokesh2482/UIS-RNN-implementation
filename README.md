# Advanced Multi-Language Speaker Diarization System

## Overview

This project implements an enhanced neural network architecture for speaker diarization, extending beyond traditional UIS-RNN approaches with multi-task learning, attention mechanisms, and ensemble clustering techniques. The system achieves robust performance across multiple languages using the CallHome dataset.

## Key Innovations

### Architecture Enhancements

**Beyond Standard UIS-RNN:**
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism for improved temporal modeling
- Three-headed output architecture (speaker embeddings, change detection, VAD)
- Bidirectional LSTM with layer normalization for better feature extraction
- Enhanced contrastive learning for speaker embedding discrimination

**Feature Engineering:**
- 55-dimensional feature space combining:
  - MFCCs with delta and delta-delta coefficients (39 features)
  - Spectral characteristics (centroid, rolloff, zero-crossing rate)
  - Prosodic features (pitch via YIN algorithm, energy)
  - Chroma features for tonal characteristics

### Training Methodology

**Multi-Task Learning Framework:**
- Joint optimization of change detection, voice activity detection, and speaker embedding
- Adaptive loss weighting: change detection (1.0), VAD (0.2), speaker embedding (0.3)
- Weighted contrastive loss with positive/negative pair mining

**Data Augmentation Pipeline:**
- Gaussian noise injection for robustness
- Feature masking for regularization
- Language-balanced sampling with inverse frequency weighting

**Optimization Strategy:**
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay (1e-4)
- Cosine annealing with warm restarts (T_0=5, T_mult=2)
- Gradient clipping (max norm 1.0)
- Early stopping with patience monitoring

### Diarization Pipeline

**Multi-Method Change Point Detection:**
1. Probability-based peak detection on neural predictions
2. Embedding-based detection using sliding window cosine distance
3. Consensus mechanism combining both approaches

**Speaker Number Estimation:**
- Silhouette score analysis across k=2 to k=7
- Eigengap method on affinity matrix
- Median ensemble of multiple estimates

**Ensemble Clustering:**
- K-means clustering
- Spectral clustering with affinity propagation
- Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
- Majority voting across methods

**Post-Processing:**
- VAD-based filtering of non-speech regions
- Segment smoothing with minimum duration constraints
- Hungarian algorithm for label alignment
